# FastAPI Fundamentals
![FastAPI Fundamentals A learning project](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90852678/176481341-a0f87f69-5368-4ef3-84b6-571300c6ab75.png)

# Why did I started this project?
The goal of this project is to introduce me to the basics of FastAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs.
By the end of this project, you will have a basic understanding of how FastAPI works and be able to build simple APIs using this framework. **This project is the building block of further advanced projects.**

## Things I learned about during this project:

> Disclaimer: This project is focused on learning the building blocks of FastAPI instead of focusing on building the perfect app on day 1.

- I learned how to set up a development environment using FastAPI.
- I learned how to create and route requests, and handle responses. 
- I learned how to use params and typings in FastAPI using pydantic.
- I refreshed the concepts of decorators and what they are used for.
- I refreshed the concepts about swagger.
- I introduced myself to uvicorn.

## Concepts I am making use of in this tiny project.

- Typing in python.
- Class Inheritance.
- Decorators.
- Errors and Exceptions.
- Modules.



# What is FastAPI?

[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is a new Python web framework that has gained a lot of popularity in recent months. It is similar to other frameworks such as Flask and Django, but is noticeably faster and easier to use. In this tutorial, we'll go through the basics of FastAPI and how to use it to build a simple web app.

# Why do I want to use FastAPI?

There are several reasons why you might want to use FastAPI for your next project:

- It's fast. Really fast. On par with NodeJS and Go, thanks to its use of Starlette and Pydantic.
- You can code faster with FastAPI. By using standard Python type hints, FastAPI can automatically generate an interactive API documentation, which means you spend less time writing docs and more time coding.
- It's intuitive. The design of FastAPI makes it easy to use and learn. You'll spend less time debugging your code and more time building features.
- It's short. Because FastAPI uses type hints, you can declare multiple features from each parameter declaration. This helps to minimize code duplication and reduce the number of bugs in your code.
- It's robust. FastAPI is production-ready and comes with automatic interactive documentation.
- It's standards-based. FastAPI is based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema.
